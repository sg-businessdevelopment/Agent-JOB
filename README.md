# Agent-JOB

This is a prototype project built with Next.js and Vercel’s V0 design system.

## Features
- Design system integration
- Environment variable setup
- Production-ready file structure

## Getting Started In Local
### 1. Clone the repo
- **copy this GitHub project to your local computer** using Git.
- Command:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/sg-businessdevelopment/Agent-JOB.git
### 2. Run `npm install`
- This tells Node.js (via npm, the Node Package Manager) to:
	•	Read the package.json file
	•	Download and install all the dependencies (packages, libraries, etc.) your project needs to run
- Command:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
### 3. Run `npm run dev`
- This starts the project in development mode. For example, if it’s a Next.js app (which it sounds like), this will:
	•	Start a local development server
	•	Watch for file changes
	•	Allow live preview at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port is available)
- Command:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
